## Building Experience
it was intersting to build this without tailwind. geting the grids and flexbox layots to match the spacing exacly took some time. the code window in the hero section was the most complex part to style by hand. hopfully the dark mode asthetic looks close enogh to the real thing. i tried to keep the code clean even though i made a few tpyos here.
